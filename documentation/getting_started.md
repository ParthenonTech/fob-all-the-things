# Getting Started with Fob all the things

## About

## Environment Setup

Code in this project should conform to the [Google Python Style Guide][style-guide]
Conforming to a consistent style and set of best practices allows developer to
more effectively collaborate and produce software which is usable and well
understood.

## Commit messages

As per the guidelines originally codified by Tim Pope, and referenced in the 
[Git SCM Documentation][git-scm]:

>  Getting in the habit of creating quality commit messages makes using and
>  collaborating with Git a lot easier. As a general rule, your messages should
>  start with a single line that’s no more than about 50 characters and that
>  describes the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a
>  more detailed explanation. The Git project requires that the more detailed
>  explanation include your motivation for the change and contrast its
>  implementation with previous behavior — this is a good guideline to follow.
>  It’s also a good idea to use the imperative present tense in these messages.
>  In other words, use commands. Instead of “I added tests for” or “Adding
>  tests for,” use “Add tests for.” 

This provides a sample template for the commit message:

```
Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to
about 72 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first
line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of
the text as the body.  The blank line separating the
summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body
entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
the two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

  - Bullet points are okay, too

  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet,
    preceded by a single space, with blank lines in
    between, but conventions vary here
```

## Documentation

Documentation is both important (and often forgotten) in many projects.  In
order to provide a positive experience for users looking to use and contribute
to the project we write documentation using "[GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm]".

## Running the project

## Testing code
Code in this project is tested using the framework [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/).

## Submitting change sets

This project follows the normative process with GitHub of utilizing "pull
requests" (PRs).  A PR is a concise set of patches which allow a developer
reviewing code to both understand the change being suggested as well as track
how the changes move through a number of forks of a project.

When you have a change that you wish to submit, follow these docs to submit a
PR.
